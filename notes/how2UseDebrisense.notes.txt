### **Problem Statement (1 minute)**
> "Malaysia faces a marine plastic crisis. 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans annually, with rivers carrying 80% of this waste. During monsoon seasons, pollution spikes dramatically. Currently, cleanup efforts are reactive and uncoordinated. There's no system to predict where pollution will accumulate or when to act."

### **Solution Overview (1 minute)**
> "DebriSense is an AI-powered environmental intelligence dashboard that predicts marine pollution hotspots across Malaysia. We use machine learning to analyze historical cleanup data, river flow patterns, and seasonal weather to forecast where pollution will accumulate. This enables proactive, data-driven cleanup planning."

### **Technical Demonstration (2-3 minutes)**

**Start with Dashboard:**
