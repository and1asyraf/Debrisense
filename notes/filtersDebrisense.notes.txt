# DebriSense – Filtering System Notes

These notes define the filtering system across the dashboard, map, and data pages. Cursor should ensure that all filters are interactive (even with mock data) and context-aware.

---

## 🎯 Goal of Filters

Filters let users:
- Narrow down visible regions on the heatmap
- Focus on specific states, rivers, or pollution types
- Explore data seasonally (e.g., monsoon vs dry)

---

## 📍 Where Filters Appear

### 1. `/dashboard` (Map View)
- Primary location for top-level filters
- Filters update map overlays and detail panel content

### 2. `/insights`
- Filters control what regional trends and charts are displayed

### 3. `/reports`
- Filters apply to list of cleanup events and waste types shown

### 4. `/tools`
- Optional prefilter for downloadable recommendations

---

## 🧰 Filter Types & Behavior

### 1. **State Filter**
- Type: Dropdown (single or multi-select)
- Values: Hardcoded list of Malaysian states (e.g., Selangor, Sabah)
- Updates:
  - Heatmap view (only regions in that state)
  - Report list & charts
  - Cleanup zone suggestions

### 2. **River Filter**
- Type: Dropdown or autocomplete
- Values: Major rivers (e.g., Sg. Klang, Sg. Segget)

---

## 🖱️ UI/UX Behavior

- Filters persist across navigation (optional)
- Each filter component should:
  - Display current selection
  - Allow deselection
  - Collapse on smaller screens (if used)

---

## 📌 Cursor Implementation Notes

- Place all filter widgets in a shared component directory
- Use mock filter handlers to simulate updates
- Group filters visually in sidebar or horizontal toolbar
- Use `// TODO: Connect filter to real backend` in logic
- Dummy default: All filters selected (show full map/data)

---

## 🧪 Bonus (Optional)

- Add search bar to river/state dropdowns for ease
- Show active filters as tags/pills above content (e.g., `State: Selangor ⓧ`)
