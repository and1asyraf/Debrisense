   - Show river filter options
   - Toggle between Northeast/Southwest monsoon seasons

3. **Detail Panel**
   - Click region to show risk details
   - Display ML prediction scores
   - Show top pollution types

**Talking Points**:
- "This heatmap shows current and predicted pollution risk zones"
- "The ML model considers river proximity, population density, and seasonal patterns"

---

### **3. ML Insights - Predictive Analytics (4-5 minutes)**
**Navigate to**: `insights.html`

**User Story**: Data Scientist comparing past vs. predicted hotspots

**Key Features**:
1. **Seasonal Risk Trends**
   - Show line graph of risk scores over time
   - Explain seasonal patterns (monsoon effects)

2. **Regional Comparisons**
   - Display bar chart of top 5 riskiest regions
   - Show how different states compare

3. **Export Functionality**
   - Demonstrate CSV export for reports

**Talking Points**:
- "Our ML model uses historical cleanup data, satellite imagery, and hydrological data"
- "Predictions help stakeholders prepare for seasonal pollution events"

---

### **4. Cleanup Reports - Data Collection (3-4 minutes)**
**Navigate to**: `reports.html`

**User Story**: NGO Cleanup Coordinator logging cleanup events

**Key Features**:
1. **Report Listing**
   - Show existing cleanup reports
   - Display top polluting item types
   - Filter by state, river, or date

2. **Add New Report**
   - Demonstrate "Add Report" form
   - Fill out sample data
   - Show data integration

**Talking Points**:
- "Cleanup teams can log activities to improve predictions"
- "Creates a feedback loop - more data means better predictions"

---

### **5. NGO Tools - Action Planning (2-3 minutes)**
**Navigate to**: `tools.html`

**User Story**: NGO planning cleanup events

**Key Features**:
1. **Cleanup Calendar**
   - Show upcoming/past cleanup events

2. **Regional Scorecards**
   - Display risk + cleanup activity summaries
   - Show recommended actions

3. **Exportable Reports**
   - Demonstrate CSV export for stakeholders

**Talking Points**:
- "These tools help NGOs plan more effective cleanup campaigns"
- "Data-driven targeting increases cleanup efficiency"

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Demonstration Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Monsoon Season Planning**
1. Start on dashboard with Northeast Monsoon selected
2. Show high-risk zones in Selangor/Klang River
3. Switch to Southwest Monsoon to show different patterns
4. Navigate to insights to show seasonal trend analysis

### **Scenario 2: NGO Cleanup Coordination**
1. Show existing cleanup reports for a specific region
2. Add a new cleanup report
3. Show how new data affects risk predictions

### **Scenario 3: Government Decision Support**
1. Use filters to focus on high-risk areas
2. Show detailed risk analysis for specific regions
3. Demonstrate export capabilities for policy planning

## ðŸ’¡ **Technical Highlights**

### **Data Sources**
- Satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 with Floating Debris Index)
- Beach cleanup records (Reef Check Malaysia)
- HydroSHEDS DEM flow data
- Population density data

### **ML Integration**
- Predictive modeling for seasonal risk zones
- Historical pattern analysis
- Confidence scoring for predictions

### **Technology Stack**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap, Chart.js, Leaflet.js)
- Future backend: Python (Flask/Django)
- Geospatial visualization with interactive maps

---

## ðŸš¨ **Potential Questions & Answers**

### **Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: "The ML model uses historical cleanup data, satellite imagery, and hydrological patterns. While this is a prototype, the model framework is designed to improve accuracy as more data becomes available."

### **Q: How does this differ from existing solutions?**
A: "Most solutions focus on real-time IoT sensors or floating devices. DebriSense provides historical and predictive intelligence using data fusion and analytics - helping stakeholders plan proactively rather than reactively."

### **Q: What's the implementation timeline?**
A: "This prototype demonstrates the core functionality. Full implementation would require backend development, real data integration, and stakeholder partnerships."
