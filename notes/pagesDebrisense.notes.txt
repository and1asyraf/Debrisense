# DebriSense – Pages to Generate (Frontend Navigation Spec)

These are the main user-facing pages to be created in the front-end. Use mock data and placeholder elements to simulate full functionality.

  - State, River, Pollution Type
- Clickable regions show modal or detail card
- Basic legend and risk scale
- Mock GeoJSON or bounding boxes

Static content describing DebriSense project goals, data sources, and credits.

**Elements:**

- Partner acknowledgements
- SDG badges/logos (optional)

## Routing Notes

- Use clean URL routing (e.g., `/dashboard`, not `/index.html`)
- Each page = single HTML file with its own CSS/JS bundle or shared layout
- Use `<nav>` or sidebar for routing between pages
- Responsive layout is secondary (optimize for desktop first)

---

## Notes to Cursor:

- These pages should be scaffolded with placeholder content
- Each page should include `// TODO: Integrate real data` comments
- Simulate user interaction: modals, form submissions, filters, etc.
- Use consistent layout structure (e.g., shared header/sidebar)
